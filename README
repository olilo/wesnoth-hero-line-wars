Wesnoth 1.8+ Map that attempts to be similar to the Warcraft 3 Map "Hero Line Wars".

What's done:
  - only that recruiting moves your units on the enemy lane, nothing else yet

What is to come:
  - a Shop system
  - a better map
    - lanes should converge, only 1 ultimate boss (lich) at end of that lane
    - move castle/summoning grounds to end of lanes
    - general: some variance in the lanes to allow tactical combat
  - a bit of Story (i've got an idea here, but nothing more yet)
    - idea: Lich at end of lanes wants both groups to wipe each other out. why? well, that's the big question right now
  - circle at end of each lane, creeps want to reach circle or kill heroes on the way to it
  - lifes: each team has x lifes, if creeps reach circle then team loses 1 life
  - victory conditions
    - kill the lich
    - all enemy heroes die (excluding the lich)
    - enemy team runs out of lifes
  - defeat conditions
    - enemy team kills lich
    - your hero and all allied heroes die
    - your team runs out of lifes

Installation Linux:
git clone git://github.com/olilo/wesnoth-hero-line-wars.git ~/.wesnoth1.8/data/add-ons/hero-line-wars
