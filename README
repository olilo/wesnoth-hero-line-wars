Wesnoth 1.6+ Map that attempts to be similar to the Warcraft 3 Map "Hero Line Wars".

What's done:
  - only that recruiting moves your units on the enemy lane, nothing else yet

What is to come:
  - a Shop system
  - a better map
  - a bit of Story (i've got an idea here, but nothing more yet)

Installation Linux:
cp -r Hero_Line_Wars ~/.wesnoth/data/campaigns
echo "[binary_path]
    path=data/campaigns/Hero_Line_Wars
[/binary_path]

#ifdef MULTIPLAYER
    {@campaigns/Hero_Line_Wars}
[+units]
    {@campaigns/Hero_Line_Wars/units}
[/units]
#endif
" > ~/.wesnoth/data/campaigns/Hero_Line_Wars.cfg
