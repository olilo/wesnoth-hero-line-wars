Wesnoth 1.8+ Map that attempts to be similar to the Warcraft 3 Map "Hero Line Wars".

What's done:
  - only that recruiting moves your units on the enemy lane, nothing else yet

What is to come:
  - a Shop system
  - a better map
  - a bit of Story (i've got an idea here, but nothing more yet)

Installation Linux:
git clone git://github.com/olilo/wesnoth-hero-line-wars.git ~/.wesnoth1.8/data/add-ons/hero-line-wars

If you have a newer wesnoth version then you have to change the data folder of wesnoth to ~/.wesnoth<version>.
